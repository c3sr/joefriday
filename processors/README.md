processors
=======

Package `processors` provides information about the processors on a system; there are no entries for each physical or logical core; see [the cpu facts package](https://github.com/mohae/joefriday/blog/master/cpu/facts) if you want to gather such data.  There will be 1 entry per physical cpu.
